# HOW TO COMPILE AND RUN THE APP

1. Go to the root of the project

2. Give permissions 
    ```
    linux@user:~[path]$ chmod -R +x exec
     ```

3. Run this commands

    ```
    linux@user:~[path]$ ./exec/build_release.sh
     ```
     ```
    linux@user:~[path]$ ./exec/run_release.sh
     ```

N.B. if you run qmake alone this will **NOT** compile because it will generate a .pro file without the necessary flags
